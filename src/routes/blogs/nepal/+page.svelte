          <p>Nepal is burning—not just with anger but with grief, betrayal, and an unquenchable thirst for truth.
        <br/>On the evening of <strong>September 8, 2025</strong>, Nepal witnessed one of the darkest days in its democratic history—a day when bullets replaced words and protests turned into funerals.</p>

           <p>What began as a fight for <strong>freedom of speech</strong> spiraled into a <strong>deadly crackdown</strong>, leaving <strong>more than 20 dead</strong> and <strong>more than 250 injured</strong>. Among the dead? School and college students—some still wearing their uniforms.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Home Minister, Ramesh Lekhak</strong>, resigned!!!</p><p> The deadliest single-day crackdown in Nepal in years. But resignation doesn’t bring back lives.</p>

      <h2>The Spark That Ignited the Inferno</h2>

      <p>The government’s decision to <strong>ban 26 social media platforms</strong>, including Facebook, X, and YouTube, citing “failure to register under state rules”, was the last straw for a generation already fed up with systemic rot.</p>

           <p>But here’s the truth people whispered among peoples, and yelled in the streets:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <em>This was <strong>never about registration</strong>.<br/>This was <strong>about corruption</strong>.</em>
            </blockquote>

            <p>For months, social media had been the <strong>people’s courtroom</strong>. Youth-led exposés revealed the lavish lifestyles of politicians’ children—draped in designer brands, flaunting luxury cars, sipping champagne in elite clubs. All this, while <strong>ordinary Nepalis struggle with unemployment and rising inflation</strong>. The posts went viral. The hashtags trended. And the government panicked.</p>

            <p>So they pulled the plug.</p>

      <h2>Protests, Bullets, and a Bloody Silence</h2>
      <p>When the government thought they had silenced dissent by banning social media, the streets of Kathmandu roared louder.</p>

    
      <p><strong>Tens of thousands</strong> marched toward the <strong>Federal Parliament building in New Baneshwar</strong>, chanting:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>“End Corruption!”</strong><br/>
        <strong>“Down with Oli!”</strong>
      </blockquote>

          <p><strong>The order to fire.</strong></p>

          <p>It was claimed that rubber bullets were used, however, after examining the injured (protesters), the doctors reported they were caused by metallic bullets.</p>

                <p>"It's 12:30am and I can still hear the ambulance sirens outside my house", said one of the residents of Kathmandu.<br/>Further what was more chilling was what happened in the hospital. Eyewitnesses report <strong>police storming hospitals</strong>, threatening doctors, harassing grieving families. One doctor, standing her ground, told officers:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <em>“Do whatever the government says, but in this hospital, everyone is a patient and has the right to be treated.”</em>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Behind her, a voice warned:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <em>“Why do you want to drag yourself to death?”</em>
          </blockquote>

      <p>Prime Minister Oli expressed <em>“sorrow over the dead”</em>, promised <strong>compensation</strong> for families, 
        and <strong>free treatment for the injured</strong>. Further he said than an investigation committee is set up to. But the streets tell a different story.<br/>The whispers grow louder:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <em>“The investigation committee is just a cover-up.”</em>
      </blockquote>

      <p>A <strong>“so-called” inquiry commission</strong> was formed the same evening. But Nepalis know the script—delay, deny, distract.</p>

      <h2>The Rotten Core: Corruption</h2>

      <p>Let’s not sugarcoat it: <strong>This massacre was not about social media. It was about power and corruption.</strong></p>

            <p>Nepal’s political elite wanted the <strong>truth erased</strong>, but the truth bled on the streets of Kathmandu.<br/>From the <strong>expensive foreign vacations of ministers’ children</strong> to the <strong>luxury cars parked outside government homes</strong>, social media became the mirror that reflected their greed.</p>

            <p>Instead of cleaning the system, they <strong>banned the mirror</strong>.</p>

            <p>Remember Bangladesh’s corruption scandals? How the ruling elite <strong>siphoned millions</strong>, while journalists exposing the truth were jailed?<br/>Nepal is walking the same road—<strong>crushing voices, covering crimes, and killing democracy in daylight</strong>.</p>

              Their batons rained down like storms, beating her until her screams dissolved into the night.
